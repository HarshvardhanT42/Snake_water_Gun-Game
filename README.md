# Snake_water_Gun-Game
here we created a game called **sanke** **water** **gun** this is similar to the game **rock** **paper** **scissors** you can also use this logic to use this to play rock paper scissors also I will mention that in the coad

this code is written in two logics one is using integer and another is using the names

Hereâ€™s an explanation of both programs, highlighting the differences in their logic:

### Program 1:
1. **Logic:**
   - The user selects their choice by typing `"Snake"`, `"Water"`, or `"Gun"` via an input string. The computer randomly chooses one of these options.
   - The `check()` function compares the choices between the user and the computer:
     - If they choose the same option, it returns `0` (draw).
     - If the computer's choice defeats the user's, it returns `-1` (user loses).
     - Otherwise, it returns `1` (user wins).
   
2. **Input Method:** 
   - The user enters a string (`"Snake"`, `"Water"`, or `"Gun"`), and the choices are compared using strings.
   
3. **Random Choice:**
   - The computer uses `random.choice()` to randomly select from a list of strings `["Snake", "Gun", "Water"]`.

### Program 2:
1. **Logic:**
   - In this version, the user inputs a number (`0`, `1`, or `2`) corresponding to "Snake," "Water," or "Gun". The computer randomly generates a number between `0` and `2`.
   - The `check()` function uses numbers to compare the choices:
     - `0` represents "Snake", `1` represents "Water", and `2` represents "Gun".
     - As in the first program, the function returns `0` for a draw, `-1` for a loss, and `1` for a win.

2. **Input Method:** 
   - The user enters an integer (`0`, `1`, or `2`) instead of a string. The game logic is based on these integer values.

3. **Random Choice:**
   - The computer uses `random.randint(0, 2)` to generate its choice as a number.

### Key Differences:
1. **Input Type:**
   - The first program uses strings (`"Snake"`, `"Water"`, `"Gun"`) for both user input and computer choices.
   - The second program uses integers (`0`, `1`, `2`), with each number representing one of the options.

2. **Random Choice Mechanism:**
   - The first program uses `random.choice()` to select from a list of strings.
   - The second program uses `random.randint(0, 2)` to generate a number representing the options.

3. **Comparison Logic:**
   - In the first program, the comparison is done between strings (e.g., `"Snake" == "Water"`).
   - In the second program, comparisons are based on integers (`0 == 1`).

Both programs achieve the same result, but the second one uses numerical logic, which is often faster and more compact, while the first uses more human-readable string comparisons.
